Academic Journey Simulator

This project is a text-based, interactive console application that simulates a student's academic journey through a series of key decisions. Based on choices related to course load and study strategy, the program calculates and presents a final outcome, complete with a statistical summary. The core theme is to explore how different academic and social choices can lead to a variety of successful outcomes.
Branching Concepts Demonstrated

This simulator is built around a series of branching concepts to create a dynamic and personalized experience for the user. Each step of the program demonstrates specific Python principles:

    Step 1: Course Load Selection

        Decision 1 uses if, elif, and else statements to create a clear, multi-path decision based on user input. This initial choice is the primary branch point for the rest of the simulation.

    Step 2: Study Strategy Decision

        Decision 2 implements membership operators (in, not in) to validate user input against a predefined list of valid study options. It also uses logical operators (and, or, not) to evaluate more complex conditions, such as the relationship between a student's GPA and their social life.

    Step 3: Final Outcome

        This is where all the concepts come together. It uses identity operators (is, is not) for advanced checks, such as confirming the data type of a variable or whether a final message has been assigned.

        The program uses nested if statements (at least two levels deep) to handle more intricate decision logic, leading to one of three final endings.

How to Run the Game

    Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

    Open your terminal or command prompt.

    Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

    Run the script using the following command:

    python step_4_final_decision.py

Understanding the Different Endings

The simulation has three distinct endings, each representing a different path to success:

    The Exceptional Achiever: This ending is for students who choose a heavy course load, focus on a challenging subject like "Programming," and maintain a high GPA (3.7 or above). It celebrates a highly focused, academically-driven path.

    The Well-Rounded Success: This outcome is for those who choose a standard course load, maintain a solid GPA (2.8 or above), and have a high social point score (50 or above). It highlights the value of balancing academics with a rich social life.

    The Resilient Path: This is the default ending for all other combinations. It emphasizes that success is not just about specific metrics, but about growth, learning, and adaptability throughout one's academic career.
